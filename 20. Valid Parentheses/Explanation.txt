Problem Description:Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
	Solution Summary: 
	create an empty stack of characters
	loop through every char in str
	if its a ({[ then push to our stack
	else if it its empty or its )}] and the top is not its opening tag then false
	otherwise remove opening bracket
	if stack is empty then everything is matched so return that

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity:O(n) This is because we traverse the string once and perform constant time operations for each character.
Space Complexity: O(n), This is because the worst-case scenario is when all opening brackets are present in the string and the stack will have to store them all.
