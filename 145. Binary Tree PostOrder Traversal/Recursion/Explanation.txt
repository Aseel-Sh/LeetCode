Problem Description:Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.
Approach 1: Recursion
Solution Summary: 
	Initialize an empty vector to store the result.
	Call the dfs function to recursively traverse the tree.
	Base Case: If the current node is null, return from the function.
	Traverse the left subtree by recursively calling dfs on the left child.
	Traverse the right subtree by recursively calling dfs on the right child.
	Visit the root by adding the node's value to the result vector after the left and right children have been processed.

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
