Problem Description:Given ‘head’, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
Approach 3: unordered_set
Solution Summary: 
	1- if head is null then false
	2- create an unordered_set
	3- create a temp node and set to head
	4- iterate aslong as temp is not null
	5- find temp in visited. If already in set then no cycle
	6- insert curr element at end of set
	7- update temp to next element
	8- return false
