Problem Description:Given the root of a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.
Approach 1: Recursion
Solution Summary: 
	Initialize an empty vector to store the traversal result.
	Call the preorder function to recursively traverse the tree.
	Base Case: If the current node is nullptr, return from the function.
	Visit the root node by adding its value to the result vector before visiting its children.
	Recursively traverse the left subtree by calling preorder on the left child.
	Recursively traverse the right subtree by calling preorder on the right child.e been processed.
