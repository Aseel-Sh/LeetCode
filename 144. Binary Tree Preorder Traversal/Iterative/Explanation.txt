Problem Description:Given the root of a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.
Approach 2: Iterative
Solution Summary: 
	Initialize an empty vector to store the result of the traversal.
	Use a stack (stack1) to simulate the recursive call stack in a depth-first manner:
	Push the root node onto the stack.
	While the stack is not empty, perform the following operations:
	Pop the top node from the stack (this node will be the current node).
	Visit the root: Add the nodeâ€™s value to the result vector.
	Push right and left in stack (right first, because the stack is LIFO, so left will be processed first).
	Return the result vector after the traversal is complete.
