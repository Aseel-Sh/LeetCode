Problem Description:Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.
Solution Summary: 
	1- determine prev and curr ptrs
	2- iterate till end is reached
	3- store next ptr
	4- reverse next ptr to prev ptr
	5- update prev and curr ptr for next iteration
	6- return prev
Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity:(O(n)), where (n) is the number of nodes in the list. Each node is visited once
Space Complexity: (O(1)), as no additional data structures are used.
