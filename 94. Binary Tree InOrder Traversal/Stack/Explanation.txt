Problem Description:Given ‘head’, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
Approach 2: Stack
Solution Summary: 
	initialize empty vector, create TreeNode stack
	iterate through list, add curr root to stack
	update root to be left
	make root be top of stack
	pop top element and add curr root to vector
	update root to be right
	return vector

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
