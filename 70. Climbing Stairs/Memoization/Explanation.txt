Problem Description:You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
Approach 2: Memoization
Solution Summary: 
	create an unordered map of 2 ints. (memo)
	if n = 0 or 1 then just return 1 Base case. There's only 1 way to climb 0 or 1 steps
	check if the result for n steps has been calculated before
	If not calculate it and save it in memo by recursively finding the sum of n−1 and n−2. 
	return memo at n

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(n) because each subproblem is solved once
Space Complexity: O(n)
