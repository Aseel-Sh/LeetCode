Problem Description:You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
Approach 1: Recursion
Solution Summary: 
	we can use Fibonacci numbers to solve the problem
	if n = 0 or 1 then just return 1
	recursively call func using n-1 + n -2

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(2^n) due to redundant calculations
Space Complexity: O(n) due to recursive call stack
