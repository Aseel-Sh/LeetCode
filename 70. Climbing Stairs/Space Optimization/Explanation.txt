Problem Description:You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
Approach 4: Space Optimization
Solution Summary: 
	if n = 0 or 1 then just return 1
	start by initializing the number of ways to climb 0 and 1 steps
	Start from step 2 and calculate for all steps up to n
	Save the current result temporarily so you donâ€™t lose it
	Update the current step's result as the sum of the last two steps
	make prev hold the previous step's result and return curr

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
