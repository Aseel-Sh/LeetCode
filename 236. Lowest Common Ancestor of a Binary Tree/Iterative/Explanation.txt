Problem Description:Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
Approach 2: Iterative
Solution Summary: 
	If the root is null, return null. if the root equals either p or q, return the root.
	use an unordered map to store the parent of each node do DFS using a stack until nodes p and q are added to the parent map.
	For each node, add its left and right children to the map with the current node as their parent and push them onto the stack.
	Traverse the path from p to the root, storing all its ancestors in an unordered set. Traverse the path from q to the root.
	The first node encountered in q's path that also exists in p's ancestor set is the lowest common ancestor
