Problem Description:You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Approach 1: Using STL
Solution Summary: 
	Traverse through nums2 and append its elements to the end of nums1 starting from index m.
	Sort the entire nums1 array using sort() function.
	

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O((m + n) log(m + n))
Space Complexity: O(1) 
Solution:
