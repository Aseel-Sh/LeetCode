Problem Description:You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Approach 2: Two Pointers
Solution Summary: 
	Start with two pointers, i and j, initialized to m-1 and n-1, respectively.
	Initialize another pointer, k, to m+n-1. This pointer will track the position in nums1 where the larger element will be placed.
	Begin iterating from the end of the arrays using i and j.
	Compare the elements at position i in nums1 and j in nums2.
	Place the larger of the two elements in nums1 at position k.
	Decrement the pointer (either i or j) that corresponds to the larger element.
	Decrement k after placing an element.
	Repeat this process until all elements from nums2 have been placed in nums1.
	If there are remaining elements in nums1, no action is needed since they are already in the correct position.
